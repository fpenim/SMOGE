#Stochastic Modelling of Gene Expression

Proteins carry out the great majority of the catalytic and structural work within
an organism. The RNA templates used in their synthesis determines their identity, and
this is dictated by which genes are transcribed. Therefore, gene expression is the
fundamental determinant of an organism’s nature.

The main objective of this thesis was to develop a stochastic computational
model able to simulate the gene expression phenomena to best evaluate its critical
points including the process of splicing. With this aim, an extended research was
performed looking for already described similar models, identifying their strengths and
weaknesses, approaches, languages and algorithms used.

Here we present a model developed in Java, which is an object-oriented
language or object-oriented programming (OOP) implementing the Gillespie’s
algorithm.
